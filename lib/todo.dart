// TODO(ericwimp): Make a specific wrapper for each type of breakpoint to make it easy for 
// devs to just add a widget aty the top of the tree and not have to worry about the generics being assigned
// This still enables the eager dev to build out their own breakpoints but caters to the dev who just wants things to work
    //   eg. ScreenSize<LayoutSize> -> ScreenSize and ScreenSizeGranular -> ScreenSizeGranular
